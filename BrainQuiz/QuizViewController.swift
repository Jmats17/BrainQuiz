His theory was not valid but proposed that different mental abilities were modular.","neuron":"a nerve cell that consists of many different parts","Cell Body":"cell's life support center","Dendrites":"bushy, branching extensions that receive messages from other cells","Axon":"passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands","Neural Impulse":"electrical signal traveling down the axon","Terminal branches":"form junctions with other cells","Myelin Sheath":"covers axons of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses","sensory neurons":"run from the various types of stimulus receptors including touch, odor, taste, sound, vision","interneurons":"found exclusively within spinal chord and brain","motor neurons":"transmit impulses ( send messages from the central nervous system to muscles and glands)","glial cells":"hold neurons together, supports and serves as a protector of neurons, removes waste, allows them to work more efficiently. There are more of these than neurons.","Action Potential":"a brief electrical charge that travels down an Axon and generated by the movement of positively charged atoms in and out of channels in the axons membrane","Ions":"exchange of electrically charged plus & minus atoms","reflex":"simplest form of neural transmission; efferent and afferent nerve fibers fire messages to your spinal cord and brain to kick for example","synapse":"a junction between the axon tip of the sending neuron and the dendrite or cell body of the receiving neuron.","Refractory Period":"after a neuron fires an action potential it pauses for a short period to recharge itself to fire again.","Sodium-potassium pump":"pump positive ions out from the inside of the neuron, making them ready for another action potential.","Acetylcholine (ACb)":"enables muscle action, learning, and memory","Dopamine":"influences movement, learning, attention, and emotion","Serotonin":"affects mood, hunger, sleep, and arousal.","norepinephrine":"helps control alertness and arousal.","Gaba":"a major inhibitory neurotransmitter","Glutamate":"major excitatory neurotransmitter involved in memory","reuptake":"in this process , neurotransmitters in the synapse are reabsorbed into the sending process. This applies the breaks on neurotransmitter action","Brainstem":"oldest part of the brain, where the spinal cord swells and enters the skull. Responsible for automatic survival functions","Thalamus":"the brains sensory switchboard located on the top of the brain stem. If directs messages to the sensory areas in the cortex and transmits replies to the cerebellum and medulla","Cerebellum":"the little brain attached to the rear of the Brainstem","Limbic System":"doughnut shaped system of neural structures at the border of the Brainstem and cerebellum, associated with emotions such as fear, aggression, and drives for food and sex","Medulla":"base of the Brainstem that controls heartbeat and breathing","Reticular formation":"nerve network in Brainstem that plays an important role in controlling arousal","Amygdala":"consists of two almond shaped neural clusters linked to fear and anger","Hypothalamus":"lies below the thalamus. Directs several maintenance activities like eating, drinking, body temp, and control of emotions. Helps govern the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.","Nervous System":"consists of all the nerve cells. It is the bodies speedy electrochemical communication system","Central Nervous System (CNS)":"brain and spinal cord", "Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)":"the sensory and motor neurons that connect the central nervous system to the rest of the body"]
